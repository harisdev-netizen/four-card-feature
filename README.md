## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

1. **Google Fonts Setup:**
Integrated Poppins font using the `@import` method to improve the overall typography and provide a sleek, modern look to the text elements.
<br>

2. **Custom CSS Variables:**
Defined color and theme variables such as `--color-primary`, `--color-secondary`, `--color-highlight`, and more using `:root`. This streamlined the process of maintaining a consistent theme and made it easier to tweak styles globally.
<br>

3. **Flexbox for Layout Structure:**
Used Flexbox in the `.technology__features` class to align and distribute feature cards across different screen sizes. Flexbox ensured smooth adaptability and responsive behavior.
<br>

4. **Typography Hierarchy:**
Applied font sizes, weights, and spacing to create a distinct hierarchy between titles, subtitles, and body text. `Poppins' range of weights from `100 to 900` allowed for varied emphasis across elements.
<br>

5. **Hover Effects on Feature Cards:**
Incorporated subtle hover effects using `transform: translateY(-8px);` in the `.feature:hover` class. This provided interactive feedback, enhancing user experience.
<br>

6. **Consistent Spacing:**
Managed margin and padding for layout consistency, especially in the `.technology__header` and `.technology__features` sections. This helped in ensuring enough breathing space between sections and elements.
<br>

7. **Responsive Design:**
Created responsive styles for smaller screens using media queries. Adjusted font sizes, margins, and layout behavior to maintain readability and usability on mobile devices.
